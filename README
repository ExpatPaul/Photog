Macsen's Transitioning Background (MTB)
A simple wallpaper switcher for Gnome 3

DISCLAIMER
==========
This is very much a work in progress at the moment. It works, but there is a bunch of hard coding in here (which will need to be removed at some point) and some manual configuration/set-up that you will need to do first.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN
================
MTB looks for image files in subfolders of the ~/Pictures/Backgrounds

Currently, three folders are recognised (but this will change): Daytime, Evening, Night. The program selects the appropriate folder based on the time of day.

Obviously, you will need to manually create these folders before the script can be run. You will also neet to put some images in them, of course.

USING MTB
=========
Use cron. Here's a sample crontab:

*/20 * * * * /path/to/mtb.py

And that's it.
