Macsen's Transitioning Background (MTB)
An XML based wallpaper switcher for Gnome 2

BEFORE YOU BEGIN
================
MTB builds a transition XML file in a folder based on the image files that are in that folder, You can then select that XML file as your Gnome background to get a transitioning wallpaper (in much the same way as the Gnome Cosmos background works).

Before you can use MTB, you need to create the image folder and put some pictures in it. The default folder used by MTB is /usr/share/backgrounds/macsen/ but this can be overridden when you run the command.
