It's a tough universe out there...
==================================

... so here's a collection of command-line utilities that I find handy. All of them should be pretty self-explanatory and can be executed with the --help flag if you need more information.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.


Killchar
--------
Recursively remove spaces and other annoying characters from file names


Photog

A simple photo renaming appplication
For each image file in the current folder, replaces the prefix of the file name with a ten character string representing the date the photo was taken.
