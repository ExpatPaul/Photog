Macsen's Transitioning Background (MTB)
A simple wallpaper switcher for Gnome 3

DISCLAIMER
==========
This is very much a work in progress at the moment. It works, but there is a bunch of hard coding in here (which will need to be removed at some point) and some manual configuration/set-up that you will need to do first.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN
================
MTB looks for image files in subfolders of the ~/Pictures/Backgrounds

You can use up to 24 folders, named 00 to 23. The folder name represents the hour at which MTB will start for looking in that folder for images.

If, for example, you have two folders named 08 and 17, MTB will start using the images in folder 08 at 08:00 and then switch to using folder 17 at 17:00.

Obviously, you will need to manually create these folders before the script can be run. You will also neet to put some images in them.

USING MTB
=========
MTB can be set to change backgrounds at any interval (in minutes), but you do need to configure it first with the --wait switch.

For example:
mtb --wait=15
... will set a wait time of 15 minutes between background switches.

If no wait time is set, a default of 20 minutes is used.

The switcher can be started by executing mtb with no options. This call is best added in your gnome startup applications.
